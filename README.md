# Simple YouTube
This is a YouTube Client that strips out the social aspects, such as comments and accounts, to allow you to fully focus on the videos you want to watch.

**Link to project:** https://legendary-gumption-046abd.netlify.app/

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** React, RapidAPI, MaterialUI

The videos are fetched from a youtube search api from RapidAPI and then rendered using MaterialUI components for React. React router is used to give each video its own page which also has suggested videos.

## Optimizations

Some features and optimizations I will add are pagination and and watchlist where users can add what videos they want to local storage

## Lessons Learned:

This project was helpful in keeping my React skills polished, but I also found how much easier development can be using npm packages. Usually styling is a hassle with css but using MaterialUI made it quick and enjoyable.
